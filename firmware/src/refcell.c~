    Template project main
    File name: template.c
    Author: Etienne Le Sueur
    Description: The template main file. It provides a simple example of using
                 some standard scandal functions such as the UART library, the
                 CAN library, timers, LEDs, GPIOs.
                 It is designed to compile and work for the 3 micros we use on
                 the car currently, the MSP430F149 and MCP2515 combination and
                 the LPC11C14 and LPC1768 which have built in CAN controllers.

                 UART_printf is provided by the Scandal stdio library and 
                 should work well on all 3 micros.

                 If you are using this as the base for a new project, you
                 should first change the name of this file to the name of
                 your project, and then in the top level makefile, you should
                 change the CHIP and MAIN_NAME variables to correspond to
                 your hardware.

                 Don't be scared of Scandal. Dig into the code and try to
                 understand what's going on. If you think of an improvement
                 to any of the functions, then go ahead and implement it.
                 However, before committing the changes to the Scandal repo,
                 you should discuss with someone else to ensure that what 
                 you've done is a good thing ;-)

                 Keep in mind that this code is live to the public on
                 Google Code. No profanity in comments please!
